# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Figuring out how the board worked and where the pieces went. I figured out it was corresponding to the numbers, I probably would have done this from scratch by row and column which would have been a lot more work and taken much more time despite accomplishing the same thing.


2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You would give the computer situations and tell it what to do in those, basically you would need every single solution possible. Which would take forever. Or you could use a AI such as ChatGPT and let it interact (I would say that's cheating). Although there are probably better ways to do this, I do not know of them.


3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
You could either give the computer every single possible soluion, or have it compare the board to see if you or the opponent are close to winning and if you need to block them or you could win.
